# NASA UAS Senior Design Project

For our senior design project, we are working on making an unmanned aerial system that used bio-inspired strategies to help fire fighters navigate their way inside a burning building. This project is funded by NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland.

This documentation is currently under construction.

# Flight Controller

- The Pixhawk flight controller is a high-quality and low-cost autopilot. It runs *PX4* on the *NuttX OS*.

# Sensors

- *SONAR*: used to navigate in areas where the GPS tracker may not be useful. Will help the drone sense changes in temperature and map the room.
- *LIDAR*: has a thermal camera mounted on top. used to obtain livestream video & a thermal video from the same viewpoint. the Lidar provides an accurate distance to objects. The Lidar can help the user control the vision of the drone to see inside the room. for example, the Lidar can be used to locate a body that is 30 feet away.
